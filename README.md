⚠️ Before executing this script, it is highly recommended to create a backup or restore point of your system.
Additionally, but not necessary: TEST DWMKiller and DWMRevive scripts on a Virtual Machine matching your system 1 to 1 to be sure that it is safe to use.


## !Important!

⚠️ Critical Information: Disabling DWM will cause the UAC interface to become non-functional (“soft brick”). The UAC prompt will appear blank, but you can still interact with it by pressing the “Tab” key twice (sometimes it's thrice) followed by the “Enter” key to accept the UAC request. Blank CMD window potentialy can wait for "Any key.." like "Y" for example.


## Potential Impact of Disabling DWM: Disabling the Desktop Window Manager (DWM) using this script can significantly affect various system functionalities, including but not limited to:

User Account Control (UAC)

System Stability

Performance Issues

Visual Effects

Ribbon UI

Start Menu

“Open With” functionality

Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications

..and much more ☠️


## Let’s break down the batch script usage step by step:


```
@echo off
cd /d "%~dp0"
title DWM Killer
```
Turns off command echoing, so commands are not displayed as they are executed.
Changes the current directory to the directory where the script is located.
Sets the command prompt window title


```

    echo If 2x Tab + Enter UAC accept is not working, try 3x Tab and Enter

```
Checks if the script has administrative privileges by attempting to access system file Windows\SysWOW64\cacls.exe
CACLS is a command-line tool you can use to assign, display, or modify ACLs (access control lists) to files or folders.
